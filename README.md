# best_bike_days
## Description
Fetch weather data and receive a computed output determining if there are upcoming days where the weather conditions are worth taking a few hours off to go biking. This program is intended for regularly checking local weather data, so we use a set variable for the city instead of command line user input.

There are two different applications in this repo:
1. current_weather.py  -  Creates a simple, organized table showing the current weather of a specified city.
2. best_bike_days.py  -  Returns recommendations for biking days based on the 16-day weather forecast of a specified city.

Daily weather requirements that would result in a recommendation for biking are:
- Temperature between 55-85 Â°F
- Wind speed no more than 15 mph
- No preciptation, and less than 0.2 inches of precipitation in the last 24 hours
- The recommendation also considers wind gusts and the apparent temperature / real feel

## Usage
Usage:
1. Obtain a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/ and add it to a new file "api_key.txt". 
2. For both applications, set the 'city' variable at the bottom of the file to your city name and run the python file. The string can just be '{city}', or it can be '{city},{state},{country}'. For example: 'Arlington' or 'Arlington,VA,US'. By just using the city, openweathermap may return the wrong weather data since not all city names are unique. Therefore, it is recommended to use city, state, and country.

## Weather API details
- In current_weather.py, data is fetched from https://openweathermap.org/ regarding the current day.
- In best_bike_days.py, the specified city is geocoded through the geocoding API from https://openweathermap.org/, and the returned coordinates are used to fetch the 16-day weather forecast from https://open-meteo.com/.
- Originally, openweathermap was considered for a multi-day forecast, but their free API only provides multi-day forecast in the form of 5 day / 3 hour forecast data (an exessive 40 sets of data). The 16 day forecast which was more suitable requires a paid subscription, so instead, open-meteo is used as it provides a 16-day forecast free of charge.
